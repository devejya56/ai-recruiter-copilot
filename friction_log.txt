         during development and debugging.
=============================================================================

Entry #1: Google Sheets API - Spreadsheet ID Error
---------------------------------------------------
Date: October 2025
Error: "The caller does not have permission" / Invalid spreadsheet ID
Cause: The spreadsheet ID in .env was incorrect or pointing to a 
       non-existent/inaccessible sheet.

Steps Taken:
  1. Verified the spreadsheet ID in the .env file
  2. Checked Google Cloud Console for API permissions
  3. Confirmed service account had proper sharing permissions
  4. Updated SPREADSHEET_ID in .env to correct value

Result/Fix: Corrected spreadsheet ID in .env file. Verified service account
            email (from credentials JSON) was added as an editor to the
            Google Sheet.

---------------------------------------------------

Entry #2: Environment Variables Not Loading
---------------------------------------------------
Date: October 2025
Error: Application unable to read environment variables, resulting in
       undefined values for API keys and configuration.
Cause: Missing or improperly configured dotenv package.

Steps Taken:
  1. Checked if python-dotenv was installed
  2. Verified .env file location (should be in project root)
  3. Added/verified dotenv import in main application file:
     from dotenv import load_dotenv
     load_dotenv()
  4. Confirmed .env file syntax (KEY=VALUE format, no quotes unless needed)

Result/Fix: Installed python-dotenv via pip. Added proper load_dotenv()
            call at the beginning of main script. Environment variables
            now load correctly.

---------------------------------------------------

Entry #3: Google Sheets Tab/Worksheet Name Error
---------------------------------------------------
Date: October 2025
Error: "Unable to parse range" or worksheet not found error when trying
       to read/write to Google Sheets.
Cause: Incorrect worksheet/tab name specified in code, or tab didn't exist.

Steps Taken:
  1. Opened the Google Sheet to verify actual tab names
  2. Checked code for hardcoded tab names (e.g., 'Sheet1', 'Candidates')
  3. Verified case sensitivity of tab names
  4. Updated code to use correct tab name
  5. Added error handling for missing worksheets

Result/Fix: Corrected worksheet name in code to match actual tab name
            in Google Sheets. Added validation to check if worksheet
            exists before attempting operations.

---------------------------------------------------

Entry #4: Google Cloud Credentials Path Issues
---------------------------------------------------
Date: October 2025
Error: "Could not automatically determine credentials" or file not found
       errors when accessing Google Sheets API.
Cause: Credentials JSON file path incorrect or file missing.

Steps Taken:
  1. Verified credentials.json file exists in project directory
  2. Checked GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
  3. Confirmed path in .env or code is absolute or relative to project root
  4. Validated JSON file format and content

Result/Fix: Set correct path to credentials.json in environment variable.
            Used absolute path to avoid ambiguity. Credentials now load
            successfully.

---------------------------------------------------

Entry #5: API Rate Limiting / Quota Exceeded
---------------------------------------------------
Date: October 2025
Error: "Quota exceeded" or "Rate limit exceeded" errors from Google
       Sheets API.
Cause: Too many API calls in short time period.

Steps Taken:
  1. Reviewed Google Cloud Console quotas
  2. Added rate limiting/delay between API calls
  3. Implemented batching for multiple operations
  4. Added retry logic with exponential backoff

Result/Fix: Implemented time.sleep() delays between calls. Added batch
            update operations to reduce API call count. Errors resolved.
