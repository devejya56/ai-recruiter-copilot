# AI Recruiter Copilot

AI-powered recruitment copilot with multi-LLM orchestration for automated candidate sourcing, screening, and engagement.

## üöÄ Project Overview

AI Recruiter Copilot is an intelligent recruitment automation system that leverages multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the entire hiring process. The system orchestrates various AI agents to handle candidate sourcing, resume screening, skill assessment, and automated engagement, significantly reducing time-to-hire while improving candidate quality.

Built for hackathon submission, this project demonstrates the power of multi-agent AI systems in revolutionizing traditional recruitment workflows.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Candidate Sourcing**: AI-powered search across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub, job boards)
- **Intelligent Resume Screening**: Automated parsing and ranking of candidate profiles against job requirements
- **Skills Assessment**: Dynamic evaluation of technical and soft skills using AI-driven analysis
- **Automated Engagement**: Personalized email outreach and follow-up communication
- **Recruiter Agent**: Dedicated agent in `recruiter_agent.py` for end-to-end recruitment workflow
- **Composio Integration**: Seamless integration with external tools and platforms
- **Real-time Analytics**: Dashboard for tracking recruitment metrics and pipeline status
